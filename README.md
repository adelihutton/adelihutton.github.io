Introduction
The effects of body mass index (BMI) on various aspects of health have been a key topic of interest in recent years. In particular, it has been shown that increased BMI is associated with higher LDL cholesterol, inflammation, and blood glucose levels. Using data from the Framingham Heart Study, this project explores two questions. First, we examine the effects of BMI on diastolic blood pressure. Next, we assess the effects of BMI on mortality.
The Framingham Heart Study is a long-term prospective cohort study which began in 1948, and 5,209 subjects were enrolled in the study initially. Since the study began, participants have been followed continuously and examined every two years. The dataset used for this project was obtained from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, and it contains part of the Framingham study, including clinic, lab, questionnaire, and adjudicated event data on 4,434 participants. Our primary variables of interest for our first question are body mass index, which is measured as weight in kilograms/height meters squared, and diastolic blood pressure, as defined as the mean of last two of three measurements. Additional co-variates of interest include age, sex, total cholestorol serum (mg/dL), and glucose levels. Note that the glucose covariate is defined as casual serum glucose (mg/dL). For our second question, our primary variables of interst are BMI and death. Note that death which is defined to be death from any cause.
Key questions:
(1)	What is the association between BMI and diastolic blood pressure? Are there confounders or effect modifers that impact this association?
(2)	What is the association between BMI and all-cause mortality? Does the number of cigarettes smoked each day confound this relationship?
Exploratory Data Analysis
First, we explore the data by examining a histogram of the BMI values, which is in the appendix. We see that the majority of individuals have a BMI in the range of 20-30, with a substantial amount higher than this as well.
Next we explore the association between BMI and diastolic blood pressure through a scatterplot, which is in the appendix. From this exploratory data analysis, we see that there appears to be some linear correlation between BMI and diastolic blood pressure.
Methods
We will explore the first question using linear models. This method was selected based on the exploratory data analysis. In particular, there appears to be some linear correlation between BMI and diastolic blood pressure. Recall that linear modeling is used to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable. Since both BMI and diastolic blood pressure are both continuous variables, it is an appropriate choice. We will also consider several potential confounders and effect modifiers.
We will explore our second question using logistic regression. Recall that logistic regression is used to predict the categorical dependent variable, so it is appropriate since the death variable is catagorical (either the patient died or they did not). We will also consider whether the number of cigarettes smoked per day is a confounder and/or effect modifier to this relationship.
Results
We first use linear modeling to look at the relationship between BMI and diastolic blood pressure. From running a simple linear model (mod1 in the appendix), we see that for each 1-unit increase in BMI, there is a 1.10 unit increase in diastolic blood pressure, on average. Note that the p-value is <2e-16, so it is significant. This is visualized through ggplot in the appendix, and the linear trend is visable. Also note the included plots for the residual versus fitted plots, the Q-Q plot, and the density plot. These were used to ensure that the linear model was an appropriate choice and to get a sense of the residuals.
We now select some co-variates to check as potential confounders and effect modifiers to potentially improve our model. Firstly, number of cigarettes smoked per day was selected as a potential confounder due to satifying the operation definition of a confounder; cigarette smoking could potentially impact both BMI and diastolic blood pressure, but not as a downstream consequence. The following variables were selected as potential effect modifiers: age, sex, total serum cholestorol, and glucose.
Firstly, we check whether cigarettes smoked per day is a confounder by adding it to the model (creating mod2 in the appendix). In comparing the coefficients, we see that adding cigarettes smoked per day only affects the coefficient by 1%, and thus cigarettes smoked per day does not confound the relationship between BMI and diastolic blood pressure.
We next want to create new models to check whether there is effect modification with the following covariates in the model: age, sex, glucose, and total serum cholestorol. First we consider age (creating mod3 in the appendix). The interaction term between age and BMI is 0.00128 <.05, and thus it is significant. Thus age is an effect modifier in the relationship between BMI and diastolic blood pressure, so we keep it in the model.
Next we consider sex as a potential effect modifier by adding it to the model (creating mod4 in the appendix). The p-value of the interaction term of BMI and sex is 0.77415, and thus not significant. Therefor we don’t have evidence that sex is an effect modifier, so we don’t keep it in the model.
We now consider glucose as a potential effect modifier in mod5 in the appendix. The p-value of the interaction term of bmi and glucose is 0.00516 < .05, and thus significant. Thus glucose is an effect modifier in the relationship between BMI and diastolic blood pressure, so we keep it in the model.
Finally, we consider whether total serum cholestorol is as a potential effect modifier in mod6. The p-value of the interaction term of bmi and total cholestorol is 0.83917, so it is is not significant, and thus we don’t have evidence that total cholestorol is an effect modifier, so we don’t keep it in the model.
Thus mod5 is the model we select as our final model for the first question, which can be seen in the appendix.
To answer our next question, we use logistic regression to study the effects of BMI on all-cause mortality.
From a simple logistic model, we see that a one-unit increase in BMI has 1.052 times the odds death from all-cause mortality compared with the one-unit lower BMI, on average, according to this data. The 95% confidence interval for the effect of a 1-unit change in BMI is [1.04, 1.07]. In addition, a five-unit increase in BMI has 1.290 times the odds death from all-cause mortality compared with the 5-unit lower BMI, on average, according to this data. The 95% confidence interval for the effect of a 5-unit change in BMI is [1.1964, 1.3909]. This simple model is a significant predictor of mortality due to the p-values.
The data is visualized through ggplot in the appendix, and you can see dichotomous nature of the data. Also note the included plots for the residual versus fitted plots, the Q-Q plot, and the density plot.
We now consider possible nonlinear effects of BMI by running a logistic regression with a linear and quadratic term in the same model. From running the model, we see that quadratic term is not needed because the bmi^2 term has a high p-value. Notice from the graph in the appendix that the fitted probabilities from these two models shows the linear model and the quadratic model are very similar. In conclusion, the simple logistic model is sufficient; the quadratic term is not needed.
Now we want to explore whether the number of cigarettes smoked each day is a confounder or effect modifier in the relationship between BMI and all-cause mortality. By adding cigaretttes smoked per day to the model, we see that the number of cigarettes smoked per day does confound the relationship between BMI and all-cause mortality, since the difference in coefficients is 13%. However, it is not an effect modifier since the p-value of the interaction term is 0.357 > .05, and thus not significant.
Conclusions
The first question explored the association between BMI and diastolic blood pressure and potential confounders and effect modifers that impact this association.
In our original simple linear model (lm(diabp ~ bmi)), we found that each 1-unit increase in BMI is associated with a 1.10 unit increase in diastolic blood pressure, on average.
Note that the p-value of this model was significant. We also explored whether several co-variates selected via subject matter knowledge were confounders and/or effect modifers. We found that the number of cigarettes smoked per day is not a confounder to the relationship between BMI and diastolic blood pressure since it did not satisfy the statistical definition of a confounder.
Through running additional models, we found that age and glucose levels are effect modifiers, while sex and total cholestorol serum are not. The best model we found was mod5 in the appendix (which accounted for age and glucose levels as effect modifiers), and its summary and residuals can be found in the appendix.
The linear modeling approach to be successful since it identified two effect modifiers (and ruled out two other potential effect modifiers and a potential confounder). With more time, it would be interesting to add quadratic or cubic terms to the model or potentially a spline to see whether they improved the model.
For the second question of interest, the association between BMI and all-cause mortality, we found that a five-unit increase in BMI has 1.290 times the odds death from all-cause mortality compared with the 5-unit lower BMI, on average, according to this data. The 95% confidence interval for the effect of a 5-unit change in BMI is [1.1964, 1.3909]. This simple model is a significant predictor of mortality due to the p-values and a better model choice than the logistic model that included both a linear and quadratic term. We also found that the number of cigarettes smoked per day does confound the relationship between BMI and all-cause mortality but it is not an effect modifier.
Logistic regression was successful for this question since the outcome data was categorical, and from the simple model we were able to determine results with a significant p-value. With more time, it would be interesting to consider additional confounders and effect modifiers to the relationship between BMI and all-cause mortality, such as age and sex.
