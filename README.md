Introduction

The effects of body mass index (BMI) on various aspects of health have been a key topic of interest in recent years. In particular, it has been shown that increased BMI is associated with higher LDL cholesterol, inflammation, and blood glucose levels. Using data from the Framingham Heart Study, this project explores two questions. First, we examine the effects of BMI on diastolic blood pressure. Next, we assess the effects of BMI on mortality.
The Framingham Heart Study is a long-term prospective cohort study which began in 1948, and 5,209 subjects were enrolled in the study initially. Since the study began, participants have been followed continuously and examined every two years. The dataset used for this project was obtained from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, and it contains part of the Framingham study, including clinic, lab, questionnaire, and adjudicated event data on 4,434 participants. Our primary variables of interest for our first question are body mass index, which is measured as weight in kilograms/height meters squared, and diastolic blood pressure, as defined as the mean of last two of three measurements. Additional co-variates of interest include age, sex, total cholestorol serum (mg/dL), and glucose levels. Note that the glucose covariate is defined as casual serum glucose (mg/dL). For our second question, our primary variables of interst are BMI and death. Note that death which is defined to be death from any cause.

Key questions:

(1)	What is the association between BMI and diastolic blood pressure? Are there confounders or effect modifers that impact this association?
(2)	What is the association between BMI and all-cause mortality? Does the number of cigarettes smoked each day confound this relationship?
